== General rules
* 19x19 grid
* winner with most bots after 100 turns
* every 10 turns 5 bots spawn randomly; bots already standing there die

Implement:

    import rg                  # pip install rgkit
    class Robot:
        def act(self, game):
            ...
            return [...]

== Actions
`return` one of these values from `act()` method:

* move `["move", (x, y)]`
* attack (after all movement) `["attack", (x, y)]`
* suicide `["suicide"]`
* guard `["guard"]`

== Statistics
* initial health 50 HP
* collision lose 5 HP (not movement)
* attack removes 8-10 HP
* suicide removes 15 HP to all next
* guard takes half damage
* no friendly damage (attack, suicide, movement)

== Coding
* class and module global vars shared between calls; called once per bot
* library methods `rg.` on https://robotgame.net/rgdocs (mainly for location calc, distances, ...)
* `rg.settings.` for default properties
* some timeouts for security (https://robotgame.net/security)

== Data

As robot instance attributes:

* `self.location = (x, y)`
* `self.hp`
* `self.player_id` (team)
* `self.robot_id` (unique per robot)

Passed as parameter to `def act(self, game)`:

    game = {
        "robots": {(x1, y1): {"location":(x1, y1),
                              "hp":...,
                              "player_id":...,
                              "robot_id":...},  # only for own bots
                   (x2, y2): {...},
                   ...
                   }
        "turn": <num>                           # starts at zero
        }

For convenience you can also use attribute access `.robots`, `.location`, ... instead of dictionary `["robots"], ...` access.

== Running
* `rgrun bot1.py bot2.py`
* `-H` for headless (not GUI)
* `-c <num>` for multiple games
