* Biclustering: In a matrix, rows and columns are assigned to clusters, such that their submatrices have desirable properties. See `sklearn.cluster.bicluster`
* Covariance estimation: Estimate covariance of features given a set of points. See `sklearn.covariance`. Related to Gaussian graphical models.
* Random Trees Embedding: Unsupervised method where totally random tree determines one-hot encoding by its leaves. See `sklearn.ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding`. Neighboring points more likely to have similar encodings.
* Isotonic regression: Regression such that estimations are monotonically increasing.
* Cross decomposition: PLS (partial least squares) or CCA (canonical correlation analysis). Find latent variables which explain relations between matrix X and Y.
* Gaussian Mixture Model: All data is generated from a mixture of finite number of Gaussians with unknown parameters.

* Partial dependence plot: For GBRT in `sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence`. Marginalized over all other features.

== Cross-validation

* Methods like ElasticNet, Lasso, LogReg, ... can fit multiple parameters incrementally, reducing computation
* LassoLarsIC can choose parameters by AIC or BIC
