= Easy infrastructure
* Crestle.com: Instant Jupyter notebook, but more expensive
* Paperspace: good
** turn off auto snapshot, enable public IP
** pasting clipboard: Ctrl-Shift-V (e.g. Password)

= Get started
* 250GB
* curl http://files.fast.ai/setup/paperspace | bash (~1h setup: cuda, anaconda, libraries)
* reboot
* git pull (fastai)
* conda env update (sometimes)
* jupyter -> use IP instead of "localhost"

= Other
* fast.ai on PyTorch
* includes many best practices from DL
* .lr_find(): from "Cyclical leanring rates for training n.n."
** try (exp) l.r. and see where you had most improvement
** plot and pick largest rate where still clearly improving
* epochs until test gets worsell
