== Separate Product Owner and Disciplinary Manager

* PO only tells "What" but not "How" and should not enforce it (threatening with bonus, due to pressure from above)

== Other

* there are no "data science products", only projects
* need vision to know where to go and what to work on

== Scrum

* big user stories -> epics; in Jira rather a theme and label
* actionable insights
* spike: no estimation -> time-box instead
* user story: business value?; who, what, why
* multi-colored backlog if multiple products
