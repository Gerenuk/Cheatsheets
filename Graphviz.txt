------- layout ---------
Node placement: 
manual, full graph:
ordering=out, outputorder
layout (specify algorithm to use [neato,...])
Node distance: defaultdist, mindist, nodesep
normalize (rotates graph so that first node is top left corner)

manual, components:
pin (pin node to input position)
pos (position of node or edge)
rank, rankdir, ranksep
root (center of graph)

auto-layout, full graph:
overlap
sep (node size factor 1+sep; except for ipsep or vpsc)
smoothing (sfdp) (remove uneven distribution of nodes)
start (starting position, fdp/neato only)
dim (number of dimensions)
levels (sfdp) (number of levels allowed)
levelsgap (strictness of levels contraint to neato for ipsep/hier)
repulsiveforce (sfdp)
voro_margin (scale up drawing to allow margin for expansion in voronoi)
iterations: nslimit, maxiterm, mclimit (cross-iterations), epsilon (0.0000001, neato only)

dot only:
searchsize

Spring system: Damping, K, mode, model, quadtree

Clusters: clusterrank="local" -> clusters calculated separately, compound, remincross, pack, packmode
--------------------------------------
avoid overlap: first nodes enlarged using "sep"
overlap=scale -> overlap removed by uniform scaling
overlap=false -> Voronoi technique
overlap=scalexy -> scale independently to remove overlap
sfdp + overlap=prism -> proximity graph-based (best); overlap_scaling used, default "prism1000" -> 1000 attempts to remove
compress -> layout scaled down without introducing overlaps

experimental:
mode=ipsep + overlap=vpsc -> quadric optimization to minimize node displacement (similar to ortho)
mode=ipsep + overlap=ipsep -> overlap into layout already
mode=ipsep + mosek=true -> mosek software used

node-edge overlap: neato -Goverlap=... -Gsplines=true -Gsep=.1  (sep 0.1 -> node treated as if 110%)
neato -Gstart=5 ... (other seed)

labelfloat=false
