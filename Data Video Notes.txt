Ng:
* used to be feature engineering:
* image features: SIFT, GIST
* speech: GMM, HMM

== Feather

* for sharing
* loosely based on Arrow

== Pomegranade

* https://youtu.be/YBknijEiABA?t=8m15s
* fast and intuitive
* combine HMM, GMM, NB, Graphical, ...
* even faster than numpy, scipy, sklearn... for prob tasks

== Prob model of dwell time

* Gamma is prior for Exp-Normal
* -> use harmonic mean (with bias) to estimate expected center (since averaging rates)
