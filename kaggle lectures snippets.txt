np.diff
plt.plot(x,".")  # plot index vs x
which number (almost) always smaller than other
look at xa/xb plots; pd.scatter_matrix
kmeans on correlation matrix -> find feature groups
plot at feat means; maybe groups
df.nunique(axis=1)==1     # dropna=False
df.T.drop_duplicates()  # dupli cols
.. or do .factorize() before in case there is just a mapping
duplicated rows?
plot means vs rows index; does mean shift?
or RF predict row index; feat imp
df.isnull().sum(axis=1)
or axis=0 for cols
some value always maps to particular other value?
.index.tolist()
large integers could ne nanoseconds
feat: how many cols are exactly equal in this row
how many rows in colA are greater than colB; also for dates
spikes in histogram? where are? regular?
maybe divmod features useful?
pickle.dump(.., protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
sns.set(palette=)
sns.set(font_scale=2)
ShuffleSplit (if enough data), Kfold (if inhomo), LeaveOneOut
Stratification: for small, unbalanced, many multi-class
!need same validation as test split; i.e. exactly random OR timesplit
feature husbad/wife which are separate in train/test
id-based split: diff objects in train/test
keep specific ratio of news id objects in validation
diff optimal param on validation folds?
too little data; too diverse data; similar samples with diff targets? (inconsistent)
-> diff seeds and average scores?
leaderboard diff distr: what is optimal constant submission -> adjust prediction
weights of categories might change -> mimic in validation set
train: only recommended songs; test: all songs
