Transform handwriting to path and color:
* scan image
* transform to path (will create "one" huge path)
* to color parts:
** break apart path (empty letters like "o" will be filled)
** combine element and color
** combine rest (to fill letter)
** to easier select everything but the colored object
*** hide (obj.props, but object disappears)
*** lock (obj.probs, but not selectable)
*** obj to new layer
