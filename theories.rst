Bayesian Approach
=================
* main component is prior
* with prior you could calculate anything (even average hypothesis or error on this)
* for example:
  * for perceptron use distribution over weights (e.g. uniform)
  * but if uniform: you'd know average and stddev; however real unknown could be completely different!

When is Bayesian justified?
---------------------------
* when prior valid (since known for some reason)
* when prior is irrelevant (just a catalyst)
