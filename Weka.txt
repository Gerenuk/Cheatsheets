Weka:
* 4 choices:
  * Explorer
  * Experimenter (performance comparisons)
  * Knowledge flow (graphical interface)
  * Simple CLI (command line interface)
* a lot of classifiers
* classifiers give text output
* J48: C4.8 (last free) in Java
* can do manual classifier (UserClassifier [tree]): select rectangle and polygons in data
* 10cv better variance than 10x random cv?!
* tree can be pruned by confidence (keep default values)
* kNN = Weka IBk
* kNN n\to\infty, k\to\infty k/n\to 0 --> error approaches theoretical minimum
* Weka boundary visualizer (visualization menu)
* trees/m5p: trees of regression models
* many methods; not fully logical interface; boundary visualizer but ugly

stratified CV: each fold has right ratio of classes
Click on data point

does new dataframe from df[] inherit properties?
graph language to easily do things 
baselinr classifier: guess majority; or a simple tree? 1 level; OneR method (when too simple or too complex) Rob Holte 1993
classes output their parameters
