[glossary]
Universal numeric fingerprint:: Signature of a document that is dependent on contents, but not format (http://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.5.1/developers/unf/unf-v6.html)
CoCoA:: Communication Efficient Coordinate Ascent
Biclustering:: In a matrix, rows and columns are assigned to clusters, such that their submatrices have desirable properties. See `sklearn.cluster.bicluster`
Covariance estimation:: Estimate covariance of features given a set of points. See `sklearn.covariance`. Related to Gaussian graphical models.
Random Trees Embedding:: Unsupervised method where totally random tree determines one-hot encoding by its leaves. See `sklearn.ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding`. Neighboring points more likely to have similar encodings.
Isotonic regression:: Regression such that estimations are monotonically increasing.
Cross decomposition:: PLS (partial least squares) or CCA (canonical correlation analysis). Find latent variables which explain relations between matrix X and Y.
Gaussian Mixture Model:: All data is generated from a mixture of finite number of Gaussians with unknown parameters.
Partial dependence plot:: For GBRT in `sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence`. Marginalized over all other features.
