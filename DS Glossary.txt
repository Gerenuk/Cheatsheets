[glossary]
Universal numeric fingerprint:: Signature of a document that is dependent on contents, but not format (http://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.5.1/developers/unf/unf-v6.html)
CoCoA:: Communication Efficient Coordinate Ascent
Biclustering:: In a matrix, rows and columns are assigned to clusters, such that their submatrices have desirable properties. See `sklearn.cluster.bicluster`
Covariance estimation:: Estimate covariance of features given a set of points. See `sklearn.covariance`. Related to Gaussian graphical models.
Random Trees Embedding:: Unsupervised method where totally random tree determines one-hot encoding by its leaves. See `sklearn.ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding`. Neighboring points more likely to have similar encodings.
Isotonic regression:: Regression such that estimations are monotonically increasing.
Cross decomposition:: PLS (partial least squares) or CCA (canonical correlation analysis). Find latent variables which explain relations between matrix X and Y.
Gaussian Mixture Model:: All data is generated from a mixture of finite number of Gaussians with unknown parameters.
Partial dependence plot:: For GBRT in `sklearn.ensemble.partial_dependence`. Marginalized over all other features.
Robust PCA:: "Robust PCA" (Candes 2009); http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/RobustPCA.pdf[Paper]; Repeated do SVD and threshold
Structured learning:: Target arbitrary structured data (not just a number); https://pystruct.github.io/intro.html#intro[Into from PyStruct]
Guided Evolutionary search:: Making of of approximate (biased) gradient information; arXiv 1806.10230
Entropy Weighted K-Means:: Subspace K-Means
Interaction information: Information theory relation for multiple variables: What is present beyond which is present in subsets
Dual total correlation (Excess entropy): Non-negative generalization of mutual information
Total correlation: Generalization of mutual information
V-optimal histograms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-optimal_histograms
Bagplot: Like Boxplot for 2D/3D; encircle 50% of data etc.; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagplot
Tukey-Lambda distribution: Functional relation of quantiles with 1 parameter to detect whether Normal/Cauchy/Logistic; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey_lambda_distribution
Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter: Iterative MA filter; robust, nearly optimal; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Zurbenko_filter
Savitzky–Golay filter: Least-squares fit of local low-degree polynomials; analytical solution if equally spaced points
Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm: reduce number of segments of discrete curve
Kalman filter: use noisy measurements over time to produce a better estimate; state vector evolves as matrix multiplication from previous state and control state vector
