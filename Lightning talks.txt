= Black coding style
* specifys PEP8 more uniquely
* line length 90ish better
* always use trailing commas
* use double quotes (can use ', C uses ")
* pip install black
* -> PEP8 is fine; but longer line length makes sense

= Glom nested data operator
* access nested data (e.g. with dot-notation)
* better error messages (when intermediate fails)
* can also define multi access, "declare final data structure"
* built-in data exploration/debugging
