Convolutional neural network:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6hpQwq7Inw
* edges most valueable; normalize image (increase training speed); contrast normalization (like edge detector)
* 32x32 image (need to rescale and shift)
* convolution: expresses amount of overlap; use Gabor filters (detects orientation; vertical, horizontal, +45, -45)
* 1. filters (not quite Gabor filters) which are effectively similar to edge detection
* 2. use Tanh, Abs
* 3. subsampling, Tanh layer
* 4. convolution map
* 5. linear classification

Mahout:
* Hadoop
* starting to support Spark and H20 (http://gigaom.com/2014/03/27/apache-mahout-hadoops-original-machine-learning-project-is-moving-on-from-mapreduce/)

Oryx:
* ML with Hadoop by Cloudera

MLlib:
* Spark ML

Apache Spark:
* open-source data analytics cluster computing framework
* on top of Hadoop but with in-memory loading
* 100x faster than Hadoop

Plot:
Box-Plot (by Tukey): plot Median, Q25, Q75, Min, Max; but consider values  x < Q25-1.5*(Q75-Q25) and x>Q75+1.5*(Q75-Q25) outliers

K-Means:
Disadv
* worst case is superpolynomial
* results can be arbitrarity bad wrt objective function of optimal clustering
* fro small data initial grouping can determine clusters
* need to set K
* don't know attribute weighting
