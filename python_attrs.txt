Python attrs:

* remove boilerplate from classes (variable declaration, dunder methods)
* define class variables (and types and default values, ...) as class attributes
* create repr, comparison, init
* no runtime penalty
* compare vs others:
** vs namedtuple: not implicit iter/unpack, difficult to subclass
** vs dataclasses: ok , but less powerful (no validator), faster development
** vs dicts: keys not fixed
-> using dataclasses OK if you do not need special features (validators, converters,...)
