Regression might be too noisy -> predicts mean only -> use classification (or multiclass)
Maybe use same class for extreme deviation (both sides)

Kerberos feature learning (proprietary):
* time invariant
* indep of clones
* indep of order within one time period
-> convolution + pooling

Autoencoder on each "event"
Learn aggregated representation
