Voila:
* turn notebooks simply into dashboards
* use ipywidgets
* tied to Jupyter cells; shows cell exactly?

Panel:
* can import py-files which generate plots
* slow to load?
* errors don't show
* can use any plotting
* for custom data science tasks

Streamlit:
* errors shown in UI
* shows spinner when busy
* re-rendered stuff is grey
* every interactions re-runs code?

Dash:
* mostly standalone apps
* reveals more HTML
* mostly Plotly for plots

Compare:
