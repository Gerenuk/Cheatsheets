= Amazon Web Services

* multiple Regions: everything always stays within this region (use select manually)
* multiple Availability Zones per Region: for fault tolerance (e.g. different locations for risk minimization)
* Points of Presence: Edge locations
* 1 Data center about 25MW, not too big
* no official uptime numbers given
* official data protection: Privacy Shield, Safe Harbour
* AWS will hand out data if law requires (e.g. US)
* https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/
* Complicance certificates https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/
** SOC 1&2 probably most technical
* AWS is "GDPR compliant"
* by law location Ireland and Frankfurt are the same, but Ireland may be cheaper and has features earlier
* AWS provides secure infrastructure, but customer has to manager software (https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
** AWS: hardware, databsae, networking, regions
** Customer: encryption, network, firewall, authentication, OS
* technically US engineers could read data, but policies prevent that
* roles:
** Data Controller: operator
** Data Subject: users affected(?)
** Data Processor: AWS
* "Snowball" could let you extract bulk data
* you pay for: compute, storage, data out (not "in"), DDoS protection, ...
* for the default encryption keys (not user managed) Amazon has root keys
* "CloudTrail" tracks all accesses (even if US gov)
* Key Management Service KMS: best to "bring-your-own-key"
* has HSM anc CloudHSM for security
* but AWS account user can always read everything (unless you do separate AWS account and share key?)
* you can disable certain feature in AWS account by Amazon, so that even account user cannot change ("Organisation" restriction)
* "Config": e.g. can set alert for misconfiguration
* consulting support usually from partners and not Amazon

== Usual application structure
* VPC (e.g. from templates)
* Internet Gateway: access to internet
* Virtual Private Gateway: access to internals; extra cost however
* layered structure, with firewalls allowing only interaction between layers ("Security groups")
* Nginx, port 443, encryption in transit
* NACL: Network Access Control List
* Amazon Machine Image: still needs to be hardened according to own rules
* Deployment mechanism needed
* need URL; certificate manager
* on new CVE security report -> update Linux
* other Amazon Services (e.g. DB) could be provisioned as virtual endpoint in VPC

== Fargate
* just run simple Docker
* not in Frankfurt yet

== MxNet model server
* expose pretrained model
* preconfigure Docker+Flask

== Cognitio
* (external) user manager
* easiest with REST API which works on resources

== AWS Lambda
* only charged by call

== Sagemaker
* machine learning notebooks and more?

== Spot instances?

== Cloud Customdian
* ?
