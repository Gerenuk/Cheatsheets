= Misc

* Frege's theorem: Peano axioms can be derived in second-order logic from Hume's principle
* Presburger arithmetic: weaker than Peano since no multiplication, but decidable
* BKM Algorithmus berechnet Log/Exp in Digitalschaltung
* Discriminant vanishes if polynomial has multiple roots
* If a function of a complex variable is once differentiable, it's infinitely differentiable.
* Brouwer's fixed point theorem, which has several non intuitive consequences in the real-world such as:
* The fact that if you lay a piece of paper on your desk and trace around its outline, then crumble/wad the paper up and put it back inside the lines that there will always be a point on the paper exactly above where it started relative to the desk
* And, no matter how you stir your coffee there will always be some point in the liquid that ends in the same place that it was before mixing.
* x*y^(sgn(x)) is associative but not commutative
* Blaschke's Theorem: A convex planar domain with minimal generalized diameter >1 always contains a circle of radius 1/3
* Ham Sandwich Theorem: The volumes of any  -dimensional solids can always be simultaneously bisected by a -dimensional hyperplane
* Space curves Fundamental theorem: Exactly determined by curvature and torsion as function of path lenth
* Condition number: The ratio  of the largest to smallest singular value in the singular value decomposition of a matrix. The base-logarithm of  is an estimate of how many base- digits are lost in solving a linear system with that matrix. In other words, it estimates worst-case loss of precision
* Tetrahedra pack tightly, even when jumbled together 
* Bernstein polynomials: Used for approxating functions
* anti-social jogger problem: can you go on straight line from a corner of platonic solid and come back without touching any other corner. you can do that only for dodecahedron, not the others (which tile a plane)

= Curiosities

* x^2+y^2(1-x)^3 has only one stationary point which is a minimum, but its not the global minimum (see x>>1)
* random walks in 1D and 2D return to origin infinitely many times. But not in 3D
* a1=1; a(n+1)=(1+a1^2+a2^2+...+an^2)/n; first to be non-integer is a44
* sin(x−y)sin(x+y)=(sinx−siny)(sinx+siny).
* Wedderburn’s Theorem: Every finite division ring is a field. Why should finiteness imply commutativity???
* An n point Gaussian quadrature rule, yields an exact result for polynomials of degree 2n−1 or less
* Another nice example (not a graphical example) is whether x^n−1 always factors (over Z) into polynomials whose coefficients are either -1, 0, or 1. The answer is no, but the first counterexample is in the early 100s.
* In 3D and 4D: if section volume of n-dim convex body is smaller than another body, then its volume is also smaller (Busemann-Petty Problem)
* Picard’s Great Theorem: In every neighborhood of an essential singularity of an analytic function, the function takes on every value, with at most one exception.
* For any matrix, column rank = row rank
* It seems weirdly arbitrary to me that you can comb a hairy n-sphere if n is odd, but that this is impossible when n is even
* A strictly increasing function can have zero derivative.
* Chaos cannot exist in one- or two-dimensional continuous dynamical systems. Among other things, this means that in one or two dimensions if you supply similar inputs you will get similar outputs.
However, in 3 or more dimensions the dynamics can be chaotic, meaning that similar inputs do not necessarily lead to similar outputs (you can witness this in the Lorenz equations, a crude model for atmospheric dynamics).
* A beautiful result by Erdős: In any sequence of distinct n^2+1 integers, there is always some increasing or decreasing subsequence of length n+1
* If you drop a map of your country on the floor, there will be a point on the map that touches the actual point it refers to
* e^{1-x^2} (x!=0) and 0 when x=0 has Maclauren series 0

== Entropy
* zero if only one prob 1
* H(0.5,0.5)=1
* any different probs after log can only increase entropy
* max entropy for equal probs

=== Recursivity

asciimath:[H(p_1,p_2,...)=H(p_1+p_2,p_3,...)+(p_1+p_2)H(p_1/(p_1+p_2), p_2/(p1+p2))]
